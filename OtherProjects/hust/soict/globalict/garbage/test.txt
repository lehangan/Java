Create a new class GarbageCreator. Create “garbage” as much as possible and observe when you run 
a program (it should let the program hangs or even stop working when too much “garbage”). Write another 
class NoGarbage to solve the problem.
Some suggestions:
- Read a text/binary file to a String without using StringBuffer to concatenate String (only use + 
operator). Observe and capture your screen when you choose a very long file
- Improve the code using StringBuffer. 
The following piece of code is a suggestion for your implementation
